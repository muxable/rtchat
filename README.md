## Getting Started

RealtimeChat is a standard Flutter application. We support Android and iOS but not web. To get started, follow the standard

```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

If this is your first exposure to Flutter, follow the [install guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to set up your environment. Optionally, go through the [codelab](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab) to learn how Flutter applications are written.
