## Getting Started

RealtimeChat is a standard Flutter application. We support Android and iOS but not web. To get started, follow the standard

```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

If this is your first exposure to Flutter, follow the [install guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to set up your environment. Optionally, go through the [codelab](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab) to learn how Flutter applications are written.

Never contributed to open source before? All levels of experience are welcome! We're happy to help mentor you even if this is your first open source contribution. You must, however, have knowledge about what IRL streaming is and at least watch a few IRL streamers to understand the use case for a chat app like this. Stop by the Discord and ask for muxfd.
